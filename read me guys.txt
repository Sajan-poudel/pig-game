Game rules hai guys:

there are two players.

ani they are supposed to roll the dice.

and they can roll as many as they want until the dice show 1

while rolling each time the point is added up .

as soon dice show 1 the whole holded points will be zero .

as the player thinks its risky to roll many times. they can hold their point which is added to total score.

if any player achive >= 100 they they are consider as winner...

yo game pahilai nai xa hai 

this game is called pig game.......
